Hello, it's been a long time.  
I couldn't speak some grammar last English conversation lesson.  
For example "I am as tall as you" and "I don't spend as much money as you do".  
I used grammar "I don't spend much money than you" until now.  
But that's kind of childish. I was surprised. I use adult grammer from now on.
